TerminalVelocity
================

Purpose of this project is to download a large file in .net as fast as possible. Think of curl, but only for downloading large files multi-threaded and as fast as possible.
That makes things real quick and easy.
 This specifically only works with file download over http/https with servers that [accept byte range requests](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). Specifically we only support the Range: bytes={start}-{end} header.  Even more specific, this has mainly been used and tested against Amazon S3's http endpoints.
